Books are ships that sail the seas<br>
To lands of snow or jungle trees<br>
And I'm the captain bold and free<br>
Who will decide which place we'll see.<br>
Come let us sail the magic ship<br>
Books are trains in many lands<br>
Crossing hills or desert sands<br>
And I'm the engineer who guides<br>
The train on its exciting rides.<br>
Come, let us ride the magic train<br>
Books are zoos that make a home<br>
For birds and beasts not free to roam<br>
And I'm the keeper of the zoo<br>
I choose the things to show to you.<br>
Come, let us visit in a zoo.<br>
Books are gardens, fairies, elves<br>
Cowboys and people like ourselves<br>
And I can find with one good look<br> 
Just what I want inside a book.<br>
