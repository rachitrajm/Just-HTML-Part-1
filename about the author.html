Stevenson's whole life was dominated by a pulmonary affliction, periods of comparative good  health alternating with prolonged spells of acute illness and invalidism. As a young child, owning to a religious upbringing in which the main emphasis was laid on sin & its dire consequences in after-life, he lived in terror of death & damnation. Of all games he liked hide-&-seek best for it lent itself to kind of make-believe. For the same reason he liked the 'Penny Plain & Twopence Coloured' toy theatres to which he had been initiated at the age of six.</font> <br> <br>

He went successively to a number of schools, mainly at Edinburgh, but his schooling was neither exacting nor very strenuous. In 1867 he entered Edinburgh University to study for a science degree, but he was bent on becoming a writer, not a civil engineer.</b>

Stevenson loved his native city- its architectural beauties, its history & associations- but he hated his climate which was bad for him, and was deeply disturbed by an element of deceitfulness and duplicity which seemed to him characteristic of town and inhabitants alike.

During the winter of 1873-74, he began to write stories & essays, many of which appeared in CORNHILL magazine. Then he met his future wife Mrs. Osbourne, an America lady. Stevenson wrote and published some of his famous works: TREASURE ISLAND, first serialized in the periodical Young Folks, appeared in 1883; PRINCE OTTO in 1885; THE STRANGE CASE OF DR. JEKYLL & MR. HYDE in 1886; KIDNAPPED in the same year; THE BLACK ARROW in 1887. He wrote many more books, the last being WEIR of HERMISTON (left unfinished at his death). <br> <br>
