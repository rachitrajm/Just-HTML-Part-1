Of all of R.L. Stevenson's books, Treasure Island has been the most popular. It was conceived in a playful mood and deliberately written for the entertainment of the human boy, on whom any display of verbal ornamentation or philosophical profoundity would be thrown away. It has the single aim of the evocation of the emotions that are universal of youth. It was Stevenson's first attempt to reach many readers instead of a few intellectual aristocrats. That for forty years edition after edition of Treasure Island should come out, that it should be one of the most popular of its time, its very title, having a definite meaning for thousands who would have never read it, would seem to indicate that Romance is in the eclipse only in the absence of a really good romancer.<br><br>
The tale is about two boys. Stevenson's first attempt to gratify more than a coterie might have been his last. Its first appearance as a serial in Young Folks sadly failed to interest journal's readers. <br><br>
The scene visualised, Stevenson sought for his pirates and the the essential heroic boy who should circumvent them. Our conception of pirates is almost wholly based n youthfu reading; for heroic boys we seek the model transfigured in ourselves, and capable of anything up to the limits of death or mutilation. <br><br>
The story is told in the person of young Jim Hawkins, whose mother keeps the Admiral Benbow in the west coast of England. An old pirate comes to stay there with his sea chest in which there is an hand drawn map which shows where Captain Flint's treasure lies hidden. The pirates former mates turn up to steal the map, but Jim outwits them and gets possession of  it.<br><br>
Though being so old, even today it still remains one of the most thrilling reads in a world where such a plethora of adventure books are available.
