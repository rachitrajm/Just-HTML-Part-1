If the sailor sails to sailor tunes,<br>
Storm & adventure, head and cold<br>
If Schooners, islands & maroons,<br>
And buccaneers and buried gold,<br>
And all the old romance retold, <br>
Exactly in the ancient way,<br>
Can please, as they may pleased of old,<br>
The wiser youngsters of to-day<BR><br>
So be it and fall on to touch, if not,<br>
If studious youth no longer crave,<br>
His ancient appetites forgot,<br>
Kingston or Ballantyne the Brave,<br>
Or Cooper of the wood and wave,<br>
So be it also, and may I,<br>
And all my pirates share the grave,<br>
Where these and their creations lie.
